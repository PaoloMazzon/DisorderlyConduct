# Credits

I wrote the whole game myself but I used many different technologies and assets.

 - [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) for anything I "draw" myself
 - [Octarine](https://github.com/PaoloMazzon/Octarine) for my engine (I wrote it but it uses a ton of stuff under the hood)
 - [Some explosions](https://ansimuz.itch.io/explosion-animations-pack) from ansimuz
 - [Monogram font](https://datagoblin.itch.io/monogram) from datagoblin
 - [Kingdom font](https://gleeson.itch.io/kingdom-pixel-font) from gleeson
 - [Fire effects](https://ragnapixel.itch.io/particle-fx) from ragnapixel
